The following topology (figure \ref{img:topo}, taken from Moodle instructions) had to be recreated in the lab.

Each device was configured with basic settings like hostname, \ac{MOTD}, a secret enable password, disabled IP domain lookup, synchronous logging on line console 0 and the service password-encryption, which prevents passwords from being displayed in clear-text in the start-up and running configuration. The important part is that the clock-rate for the serial interface has to be configured on the \ac{DCE} device.

\ac{OSPF} is a routing protocol for \ac{IP} networks. It uses a \ac{LSR} algorithm and falls into the group of interior routing protocols, operating within a single \ac{AS}.
Concerning the \ac{OSPF} routing, every router assigns its known networks to the \ac{OSPF} routing process with area 0.

`nginx' has been set up as a webserver on a Linux-PC. The default `index.html' was adapted to show the message \texttt{Guter Webserver!} when accessing the server via a web browser. \\
The IP address has been assigned to `10.1.1.254'.
Ping and Webserver access from the User-PC to the server has been successful as shown in (figure \ref{img:GuterWebserverScreenshot}). The firewall on the Windows machines was disabled to prevent accidental ICMP failures.

For this topology the ping command from the user PC to the Linux-PC hosting the webserver took on average of 18ms and had a remaining \ac{TTL} value of 61.
The `tracert' command as shown in (figure \ref{img:TracertGuterWebserver}) from the user PC to the server shows that it takes 4 hops to reach the server.

\chapter{Router Spoofing}

For the router spoofing attack another router has been added to the network as seen in (figure \ref{img:Router spoofing topology}, taken from Moodle instructions). This router also operates in \ac{OSPF} mode. 

\begin{figure}[H]

Router X is now configured to announce the same networks as Router B. The difference between those routers is that Router X is connected via a faster connection (100 Mbps vs. 64 Kbps) then Router B.

\lstset{escapeinside={\%*}{*)},numbers=left}%oder numbers=left
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={\ac{OSPF} configuration on router X},label={lst:ospfRouterX},language={}]
router ospf 1

 network 172.17.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
\end{lstlisting}

\ac{OSPF} detects changes in the topology and computes the shortest-path tree for each route using a method based "Dijkstra's algorithm". The bad Router X propagates that he has a network "10.1.1.0/24" with the webserver.
Because of the faster connection to the 10.1.1.0/24 network, this results in a shorter path from the user pc to the webserver. The user pc doesn't know that this is a bad webserver since \ac{OSPF} only detected a shorter path to the webserver. Router C is now storing the route to Router X in the routing table, because this route has the lower path cost. Therefore, a ping from the user pc now goes to the bad server.
The ping from the user pc to the bad webserver is <1ms with a TTL of 62. Because of the new route the package isn't sent over the serial link which results in a shorter response time for the ping command. The `tracert' output (figure \ref{img:TracertBadWebserver}) shows that the package only needs 3 hops to its destination and the average response time is <1ms.

	\label{img:TracertBadWebserver}
\end{figure}

If the user wants to access the webserver again, he will be redirected to the bad webserver, because of the routing table entry in router C which states that the shortest path to the network "10.1.1.0/24" with the webserver is the one via router X.
(figure \ref{img:BadWebserverScreenshot}) shows the output when accessing the webserver.

\chapter{Router Authentication}

In this chapter, the router authentication methods are explaned. Router authentication for \ac{OSPF} allows to flexibly authenticate \ac{OSPF} neighbours. This enables \ac{OSPF} routing to exchange routing update information in a secure manner.
There exist three different types of authentication in OSPF:
\begin{itemize}
\item Null authentication: Also called type 0 -> no authentication information is included in the packet header. This is also default.
\item Plain text authentication: type 1 -> use of simple plain-text passwords
\item Md5 authentication: typ2 -> use of md5 cryptographic passwords (also not secure anymore!)
\end{itemize}

OSPFv3 is capable of using SHA1 authentication, which is at least better than MD5 authentication.

\section{Plain Text Authentication}

At first, plain text authentication has been configured.
The authentication key is configured for each interface separately by use of the following command:

\texttt{ip ospf authentication-key cisco}

Only interfaces, where the authentication key match, can participate in OSPF advertising.
The following command then enables OSPF authentication for all interfaces inside area 0:

\begin{tabbing}
\texttt{router} \= \texttt{ospf 1} \\
\> \texttt{area 0 authentication}
\end{tabbing}

When the commands above are executed on only Router A and Router C, all OSPF routes that have previously been stated in the routing table (advertised from Router B) are now lost, because Router B doesnâ€™t have the authentication configuration.
The big disadvantage of plain text authentication is, that the password can be clearly seen in the packet.

\pagebreak
\section{MD5 Authentication}

First the md5 message digest has to be set on the interfaces:
\begin{tabbing}
\texttt{Interf}\= \texttt{ace s0/0/0} \\
\> \texttt{ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 cisco}
\end{tabbing}

After that, md5 authentication can either be enabled on a per interface basis with the following command:
\begin{tabbing}
\texttt{Interf}\= \texttt{ace s0/0/0} \\
\> \texttt{ip ospf authentication message-digest}
\end{tabbing}
   
Or globally for all interfaces belonging to a specific area:
\begin{tabbing}
\texttt{router} \= \texttt{ospf 1} \\
\> \texttt{area 0 authentication message-digest}
\end{tabbing}
